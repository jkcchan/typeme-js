# Typeme.js
## Javascript Library to simulate typing.

## Syntax
`var foo = new Typeme('Hello! My name is Jacob Chan', 50);`

## What can you do with this?
### Double percent (%%) syntax:
- %%n%% : New line
- %%t%% : Tab
- %%f%% : Set flag
- %%NUMBER%% : Delay for x amount of iterations (NUMBER is any number > 0)

## What features are planned?
- %%d%% : Delete until flag (In progress)
- %%i_______%% : Italics (text between %%'s that isn't the 'i') (In progress)
- %%b_______%% : Bold (text between %%'s that isn't the 'b') (In progress)
- %%u_______%% : Underline (text between %%'s that isn't the 'u') (In progress)
- Nested commands
- Flashing cursor

## Why?
Wanted a one-line, simple library that will do this. Not much jQuery dependance either, might remove the dependance completely in the future.
